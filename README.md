# sms-spam-detection
This project demonstrates a classification model to detect if an SMS is spam or not (ham). This creates a web application that is built in Python (3.10) using the Flask framework. The classifier is created using a sequential model and embedding layers from Keras, resulting with an F1 Score of **98%**.

## Build the classifier model
1. Clone this github repo in your local machine `git clone https://github.com/TheLastMonolith/sms-spam-detection.git`
2. Move to the sms-spam-detection repositoty `cd sms-spam-detection`
3. Create new virtual python environment and activate it.  
   *using conda*: `conda create --name myenv python=3.10` then `conda activate myenv`
4. Install all necessary libraries
